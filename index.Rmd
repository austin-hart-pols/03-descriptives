# Overview of Summary Statistics

- **Why summarize?** 

  Need to synthesize findings from a large number (large-N) of records.

- **What's the aim?** 

  Characterize variation: (i) what's the shape of the distribution? (ii) what's a typical/atypical value in the data? (iii) to what extent do cases differ? 

- **How to summarize?** 

  Rely on descriptive statistics -- indices that allow us to characterize key elements of a given body of data.

- **Which statistics to use?** 

  The measurement scale determines which stats are best.

# Summarizing categorical data
## Counts and frequencies

- RECALL: Scores on categorical variables capture qualitative differences

- What to show?  
  - Relative frequency (nominal) or cumulative frequency (ordinal)
  - ...or a bar chart

- What to report?
  - Mode of distribution: score that appears most frequently.   
  - Median (ordinal): score at the 50th percentile.  
  - Shape: flat, single-peaked, bimodal, or what?  
  - Key takeaway: what do you want someone to remember?

# Graphing quantitative data

> Visuals provide a wealth of information on the distribution of scores in the data you've collected. Showing the shape, range, and center of the data is critical to communicating findings.

### Histogram
- Bar graph for quantitative measures. 

- Shows the frequency of cases within discrete "bins" of values on the scale.
]

.pull-right[
### Box plot
- Visual that marks critical ranks/positions 

- Shows the quartiles, extreme values, and outliers of a distribution
]

# Measures of center 

> A starting point for making sense of data, measures of central tendency distill information into a single, easy value. Facilitate comparisons, provide useful benchmarks, etc. 

.pull-left[

### Mean

- The average score in the data. The center of gravity.  
- Denoted $\bar{y}$ or $mu$  
- Sensitive to outliers  

$$\mu = E[Y] = \frac{\sum{y_i}}{n}$$
]

.pull-right[

### Median  

- Value at the 50th percentile.  
- Divides data into upper-lower halves.  
- Most appropriate in presence of skew.
  
]

---
# Measures of variability: dispersion

> Variability is the core of statistical research. How consistent or homogenous are the scores around the mean? Are the deviations evenly divided? 

.pull-left[
### Standard deviation

- Average deviation from mean.  
- Denoted $s$ or $\sigma$
- Empirical rule: 68/95/99% in 1/2/3 SDs   

$$
s = E[(Y - \mu)^2]^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}{n-1}}
$$
- $Z$-score: standard distance, $Z=(y_i - \mu)/\sigma$. 

]

.pull-right[
### IQR and range

- Interquartile range: upper minus lower quartile score. Captures middle 50% of cases.  
- Range: maximum minus minimum scores.

## Recap

- What to show?
  - Histogram: shows shape of distribution. 
  - ...and/or summary statistics
  
- What to report?
  - Stats: central tendency and variation
  - Shape: normal, u-shaped, flat, skewed  
  - Key takeaway: what do you want someone to remember
